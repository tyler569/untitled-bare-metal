 - X create the new cnode to be the root of the new cspace
   - X write an allocation function that allows me to pass size_bits through
 - X change the way threads are spawned to give them the new cspace
   - X factor out buffers and mapping from exec to lib
 - X update the lookup code to actually use the cspace on the thread
 - define headers for the usermode processes
   - calculator_server
   - uart_driver
 - pass page mapping bits through to usermode
   - put the bits somewhere in an accessible header
   - consume that header from both kernel mode and usermode
 - unmap pages
   - store the virtual address of pages on their caps
   - store the asid of mapped pages on their caps
     - define where we're going to put those bits
     - update the capability structure
     - update the mapping code
 - support huge pages
   - update the mapping/unmapping code to support huge pages
